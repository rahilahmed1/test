1.
    Add a little haldi (turmeric) to a small bowl of chilled curd and beat it until it makes a thick paste.
   Cover your hands with this paste and wash off thoroughly with cold water after 20 minutes.
    Do this just before your bath every day for 2 weeks and you will soon see results.

2.

    Mix baking soda with water to make fine paste and apply on the tanned areas
    Do it 2-3 times a week to see the excellent results
